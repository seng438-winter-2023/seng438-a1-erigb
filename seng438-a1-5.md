# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Firsly, the program should be run as intended to familiarize ourselves with the functionality. This will firstly allow us to understand how the program should work. It will also allow us to confirm that the program works as inteded when using valid inputs. We will test logging in with a valid card and PIN. Then we will test depositing and withdrawing valid amounts of money from the accounts. We will also test if a transaction can be cancelled by the user using the cancel button. After becoming familiar with the intended path of the program, we will begin testing the system with invalid inputs.

For the first invalid input, we will try to log in with an invalid PIN and a valid card, followed by an invalid card number. Afterwards, we will log in with one of the valid accounts and attempt to withdraw more money than available from one of the accounts. 

The last test we will perform will be entering an invalid PIN 3 times to lock a card and ensure the user is unable to take the card back.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Both exploratory and manual testing revealed various bugs about the program. During exploratory testing, hunting for bugs felt disorganized and chaotic. Even though we had come up with a plan for our testing, hunting for bugs felt like there was very little order to our work. When we moved onto manual functional testing, the process felt much more organized. During the manual testing, we found many more issues with the system. Since we were tesing every functionality of the system, we were able to find bugs in any spot they were hiding. Overall, exploratory testing is good for getting familiar with the system and how it functions. In contrast, manual functional testing is better for actually finding issues with the program in a more logical way.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
